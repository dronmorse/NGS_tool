Pipeline Steps:
Input DNA Sequence in FASTA Format

Input: A FASTA file containing the DNA sequence.

Tool: Any text editor or script to handle FASTA files.



Sequence Quality Control (Optional)

Tool: FastQC

Goal: Ensure the sequence is of high quality and free from contaminants.

Output: Quality report.



Translate DNA to Protein

Tool: EMBOSS transeq or Biopython.

Goal: Translate the DNA sequence into a protein sequence using the standard genetic code.

Output: Protein sequence in FASTA format.



Open Reading Frame (ORF) Prediction

Tool: ORFfinder (NCBI) or getorf (EMBOSS).

Goal: Identify all potential open reading frames in the DNA sequence.

Output: Predicted ORFs and corresponding protein sequences.



Protein Structure Prediction

Tool: I-TASSER, Phyre2, or SWISS-MODEL.

Goal: Predict the 3D structure of the protein.

Output: 3D protein models.



Functional Annotation

Tool: InterProScan, Pfam, or UniProt.

Goal: Annotate the protein with information on domains, families, and functional sites.

Output: Detailed annotation report.



Homology Search

Tool: BLASTP (Protein BLAST).

Goal: Compare the protein sequence against known protein sequences in databases.

Output: List of homologous proteins and their functions.



Pathway and Network Analysis (Optional)

Tool: STRING or KEGG.

Goal: Identify pathways and networks associated with the protein.

Output: Pathway maps and network interactions.
