    <h1>What does your DNA encode?</h1>

    <p>
        Do you have a FASTA file without a proper header? Maybe you have found an old DNA sequence on your hard drive that you have no idea what it encodes?
        Do not look any further! This pipeline: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>takes a FASTQ file as input or performs a test using one of the saved FASTQ files. Saves the data into a local database for later usage.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>One can also choose FASTA over FASTQ, but then the Quality Control step is entirely  bypassed</li>
        </ul>
        <li> performs Quality Control using FastQC and returns a report. Allows the user to retrieve the report and make a decision if the final Quality is sufficient to proceed with the calculation.</li>
        <li>Reads the ORFs and returns the corresponding protein sequences. If no ORF is found, provided fragment is translated left to right in an effort to find a possible protein structure. The user will be asked to choose a protein sequence of interest. It is possible to check is sequence one by one.</li>
        <li>The protein sequence gets annotated with functional and structrual infromation. </li>
        <li>The final sequence is uploaded to NCBI BLASTP server for homology assessment and a report is returned with a possible protein which is encoded by the input.</li>
    </ul>
